========================================= Prompt =========================================
To answer the question, we can first use f_sort_by() to sort the values in a column to get the order of the items. The order can be "large to small" or "small to large".
The column to sort should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort
2. DateType: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings

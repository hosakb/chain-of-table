[Instruction]
To answer the question, use f_sort_by() to sort the rows based on the values in a column. You must specify the column to sort by and the order, which can be "large to small" or "small to large".
The column to sort should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort
2. DateType: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings

Your output must be in the format:
The answer is: f_sort_by(COLUMN_NAME), the order is "ORDER"

[Example 1]
/*
col: Position | Club | Played | Points | Wins | Draws | Losses | Goals for | Goals against
row 1: 1 | Malaga CF | 42 | 79 | 22 | 13 | 7 | 72 | 47
row 10: 10 | CP Merida | 42 | 59 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 48 | 41
row 3: 3 | CD Numancia | 42 | 73 | 21 | 10 | 11 | 68 | 40
*/
Question: what club placed in the last position?
Explanation: The question asks about the club in the last position. To find the last position, we need to sort the "Position" column in descending (large to small) order. The datatype is Numerical.
The answer is: f_sort_by(Position), the order is "large to small"

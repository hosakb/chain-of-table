[Atomic Operations]

If the table only needs a few columns to answer the question, we use f_select_column() to select these columns for it. For example,
/*
col : Rank | Cyclist | Team | Time | UCI ProTour Points | Country
row 1 : 1 | Alejandro Valverde | Caisse d'Epargne | 5h 29' 10" | 40 | ESP
row 2 : 2 | Alexandr Kolobnev | Team CSC Saxo Bank | s.t. | 30 | RUS
row 3 : 3 | Davide Rebellin | Gerolsteiner | s.t. | 25 | ITA
row 4 : 4 | Paolo Bettini | Quick Step | s.t. | 20 | ITA
*/
Question: Which country had the most cyclists finish within the top 4?
Function: f_select_column(Rank, Country)
Explanation: The question asks about countries and their cyclist counts in top positions. We only need the Rank and Country columns to answer this question, so we select these two columns and remove the unnecessary information. 

If the table only needs a few rows to answer the question, we use f_select_row() to select
these rows for it. For example,
/*
col : Home team | Home Team Score | Away Team | Away Team Score | Venue | Crowd
row 1 : st kilda | 13.12 (90) | melbourne | 13.11 (89) | moorabbin oval | 18836
row 2 : south melbourne | 9.12 (66) | footscray | 11.13 (79) | lake oval | 9154
row 3 : richmond | 20.17 (137) | fitzroy | 13.22 (100) | mcg | 27651
*/
Question : Whose home team score is higher, richmond or st kilda?
Function: f_select_row(row 1, row 3)
Explanation: The question asks about the home team score of richmond and st kilda. We need to know the the information of richmond and st kilda in row 1 and row 3. We select row 1 and row 3.

If we need to extract or compute new information from existing columns, we use f_add_column() to add a new column with derived values. For example,
/*
col : Date | Opponent | Result
row 1 : April 13, 2023 | Team A | W 27-21
row 2 : April 20, 2023 | Team B | L 14-28
row 3 : May 1, 2023 | Team C | W 35-10
*/
Question: In which year did the team have the most wins?
Function: f_add_column(Year)
Explanation: The question asks about years, but the current table only has full dates. We need to extract the year information from the Date column and create a new Year column with values like "2023, 2023, 2023" to properly answer the question.

If the question asks about counting items with the same value or aggregating by categories, we use f_group_by() to group the items and get counts. For example,
/*
col : Player | Position | Team | Goals
row 1 : Smith | Forward | Team A | 5
row 2 : Jones | Midfielder | Team A | 2
row 3 : Brown | Forward | Team B | 3
row 4 : Davis | Forward | Team A | 4
*/
Question: What is the most common Positon?
Function: f_group_by(Position)
Explanation: The question asks about the most common position. We need to group the players by their positions (Forward, Midfielder) and count how many players are in each position.

If the question asks about the order of items, rankings, or finding maximum/minimum values, we use f_sort_by() to sort the items by a specific column. For example,
/*
col : Student | Math Score | Science Score | Total Score
row 1 : Alice | 85 | 92 | 177
row 2 : Bob | 78 | 85 | 163
row 3 : Carol | 92 | 88 | 180
row 4 : David | 88 | 90 | 178
*/
Question: Who has the highest total score?
Function: f_sort_by(Total Score, descending)
Explanation: The question asks about the highest total score, which requires ordering students by their total scores from highest to lowest. We sort by Total Score in descending order so the student with the highest score appears first.

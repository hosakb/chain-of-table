========================================= Prompt =========================================

To answer the question, we can first use f_add_column() to add more columns to the table.
The added columns should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort, sum
2. Datetype: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings
/*
col : Week | When | Kickoff | Opponent | Results; Final score | Results; Team record
row 1 : 1 | Saturday, April 13 | 7:00 p.m. | at Rhein Fire | W 27-21 | 1-0
row 2 : 2 | Saturday, April 20 | 7:00 p.m. | London Monarchs | W 37-3 | 2-0
row 3 : 3 | Sunday, April 28 | 6:00 p.m. | at Barcelona Dragons | W 33-29 | 3-0
*/
Question: what is the date of the competition with highest attendance?
The existing columns are: "Week", "When", "Kickoff", "Opponent", "Results; Final score",
"Results; Team record", "Game site", "Attendance".
Explanation: the question asks about the date of the competition with highest score. Each
row is about one competition. We extract the value from column "Attendance" and create a
different column "Attendance number" for each row. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: f_add_column(Attendance number). The value: 32092 | 34186 | 17503
/*
col : Rank | Lane | Player | Time
row 1 : | 5 | Olga Tereshkova (KAZ) | 51.86
row 2 : | 6 | Manjeet Kaur (IND) | 52.17
row 3 : | 3 | Asami Tanno (JPN) | 53.04

Question: tell me the number of athletes from japan.
The existing columns are: Rank, Lane, Player, Time.
Explanation: the question asks about the number of athletes from japan. Each row is about
one athlete. We need to know the country of each athlete. We extract the value from column
"Player" and create a different column "Country of athletes" for each row. The datatype
is String.
Therefore, the answer is: f_add_column(Country of athletes). The value: KAZ | IND | JPN

========================================= Prompt =========================================
To answer the question, we can first use f_add_column() to add more columns to the table.
The added columns should have these data types:
1. Numerical: the numerical strings that can be used in sort, sum
2. Datetype: the strings that describe a date, such as year, month, day
3. String: other strings

When you add values to a new column, you need to add as many valuea as there are rows.

/*
col : Week | When | Kickoff | Opponent | Results; Final score | Results; Team record
row 1 : 1 | Saturday, April 13 | 7:00 p.m. | at Rhein Fire | W 27-21 | 1-0
row 2 : 2 | Saturday, April 20 | 7:00 p.m. | London Monarchs | W 37-3 | 2-0
row 3 : 3 | Sunday, April 28 | 6:00 p.m. | at Barcelona Dragons | W 33-29 | 3-0

Question: what is the date of the competition with highest attendance?
The existing columns are: "Week", "When", "Kickoff", "Opponent", "Results; Final score", "Results; Team record", "Game site", "Attendance".
Explanation: the question asks about the date of the competition with highest score. Each row is about one competition. We extract the value from column "Attendance" and create a different column "Attendance number" for each row. The datatype is Numerical.
Therefore, the answer is: f_add_column(Attendance number). The value: 32092 | 34186 | 17503.
